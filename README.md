# wgu-student-bot
This is a chatbot I created using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) with the purpose of determining a student's best suited career based on their answers to questions

## Summary
With Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) I was able to create an interactive environment to provide a humanlike approach to student interaction. Rather than having the student fill out a form, the student speaks to the chatbot and answers the questions it asks. I also was able to include uniqueness in each interaction by having the chatbot ask the student’s name and address the student by the name provided. Upon asking questions, the chatbot can decide on the job that would best suit the student, and then provides both the job title and additional reading material to the student.

### Supported Jobs
The chatbot currently supports the following job types: Software Developer, Data Scientist, Chief Information Security Officer, User Interface Designer, and Data Analyst.

## Installation/Usage
1.	Begin by navigating in your web browser to https://pandorabots.com
2.	Click “Sign In” and then click “Sign Up” on the next page.
3.	Create an account.
4.	Once created, you should be greeted with the dashboard page. Create a new bot by clicking the + icon to the right of the “My Bots” button.
5.	Once your bot has been created, using the folder titled “wgubot”, click “File” then “Upload”, and upload the folder.
6.	Click the yellow Pandorabots button in the bottom right to test the bot and ensure functionality.
7.	The bot should now be activated. Please refer to Pandorabots documentation for deployment.

## Logging
Additional features will be added such as more questions and more job choices. The branching dialog feature will need to be presented further in the form of a flow chart to not get lost in the series of questions when developing the bot further. Monitoring can be done through Pandorabots built in logging feature, which it stores user interaction logs for up to 30 days. This will provide both feedback and bug testing for future updates.
